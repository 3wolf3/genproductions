credit/accolades for successes, 
D. Mason should be assigned any blame for bad things that might manifest.

Python configs tested in CMSSW_2_1_0_pre6

The script Herwig_mkrun.sh was used to produce the final config files,
using Herwig_minkt.txt as an input.

Fred's notes below, DAM added "Herwig_" ahead of any of the original 
filenames to identify them more clearly:

Dear Dave,

Included in this email are all necessary config files for the Summer 08 
production. So far I did not see any crashes during the test runs.

Attached to this mail is also a script called "mkrun" which uses the cross 
section and min pt settings from the file "minkt" to produce from the 
template "Herwigpp_base_cff.py" a config fragment QCD_Pt_XY.py . This file is 
processed by the cmsDriver application to create the final config file. Since 
the default cms particle listing is based on pythia it it necessary to add 
the following line is added to the config file by "mkrun":
process.genParticles.abortOnUnknownPDGCode = False

The cross section for the config files was computed with 1mio events and is 
given in picobarn in the "minkt" data file.

The current settings for cmsDriver will commission cmsRun to do 300.000 events 
for each ptmin cut to reach the requested 3mio events. This can be adjusted 
in the "minkt" file

For some reason the cmsDriver.py can not cope with the files being in the 
Configuration/GenProduction directory like described on the 
ProductionSummer2008 wiki. There is also an additional "scramv1 b" run 
necessary in order for cmsDriver to work.

Another thing I noticed was that while the Production is supposed to be for an 
early 10TeV run, the magnetic field is set to 4.0T instead of 3.8T when 
following the twiki page.

I will add some timing and space information to the twiki page today...

Sincerely,
