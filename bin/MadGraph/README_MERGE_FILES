Instructions for merging lhe files - Written by Alexis Kalogeropoulos 1/8/2011 for CMS Generators 

you need to have in the same dir the following files

--merge_file.sh ---> the shell script that wraps things...
--script_xsec.awk ---> a small awk command needed for counting how many processes are included
--merge-pl --> the actual merging script
--extract_banner-pl --> script to be used to extract banner from a LHE file

the last 2 perl script are tarred in the merging_script.tar file

In general, while merging, you must make sure that the following condition are met :

1- You are merging same processes, for example qcd with qcd not qcd with ttbar

2-The <init> block should carry the same number of processes and the same processes -- That said, you should NOT mix/merge files including different number of jet multiplicities - 
In case you try something like this, the merging script with abort

3-This script does the following... 
	a) Seperate the LHE files according to the number of the processes included in the '<init>' block - For this a reference file is being used. 
	b) The script scans all of the files and moves the files in directories according to processes- 
	c) The actual merging takes place and merges all of the files MATCHING the number of processes of the reference file - While merging, the script makes a few sanity checks, 
	   like the xsecs should match within a given acceptance difference, the number and type of processes in the init blocks should be always the same etc etc....
           Also, if a banner.txt file already exists in the current dir, the script will extract the banner info from the reference file and use it for the merged one -- 
           This is usefull as for CMS production, we need to feed dataOps with LHE files all of them carrying the same banner -- 
	   WARNING!!!! MAKE SURE THAT THE REFERENCE FILE CARRIES THE DESIRED/CORRECT INFO FOR THE FOLLOWING 
 

 	   ==> nqmatch    ! Max Jet Flavor
           ==> maxjets    ! Largest number (inclusive ktMLM matching multipl.)
           ==> minjets    ! Smallest number of additional light flavour jets
           ==> etaclmax   ! Maximum pseudorapidity for particles to cluster
           ==> qcut       ! Jet matching threshold for ktMLM scheme



	So, you should just use it like         
         '$1' = start of seed number 
        
         '$2' = end of seed number 
         
         '$3' = name of the process : This script , will assume that you LHE files have the following suffixes '7TeV_${3}_run${seed}_unweighted_events.lhe' -

         '$4' = the qcut you want to pass in 
        
         '$5' = the reference file...Please, make sure that the start_seed is greater than the run_number of the reference file
