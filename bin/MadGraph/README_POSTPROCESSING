So, correct steps for post-processing and uploading to mcdb should follow this order

First, get from CVS all the files, and do not forget to 
>  tar -zxvf upload2mcdb_replace.tar.gz

Then, 
1- Copy your files from your SE area or CASTOR (use / adapt copy_from_pnfs.sh and copy_from_castor.sh for this and rename_files.sh for correctly renaming the files for the post-processing scripts)

2- Get the x-sec and number of events per file -- For this , use the get_cross_nevts.sh and inspect the output for any anomalies

3- Do the actual post-processing with the doPostProcess.sh script

4- Create a new mcdb article with upload2mcdb.pl

5- Upload all the lhe post-processed files using upload.sh script  

6- For any questions/comments/bugs found  do not hesitate to contact the CMS MC team

7- Do not forget to have fun!!!
